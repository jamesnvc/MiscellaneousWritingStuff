# Oliver's Lifting Plan
## Or, Get Yoked for Oaks

### Goals
Strengthen back and core in preparation for tree planting this summer.

### Main exercises

  * Deadlifts (back & core)
  * Front squat (legs, core, upper back)
  * Incline bench (shoulders, balancing things out)
  * Pullups (more back, shoulders, biceps)

### Programming

Lifting three days a week, we're going to be using what's called "Daily
Undulating Periodization", or "DUP". This means you'll be doing a different
set/rep scheme each day -- both because different stresses will make your body
respond better and because it'll be more fun this way!

Rep scheme A: 4 sets of 12 reps
Rep scheme B: 5 sets of 8 reps
Rep scheme C: 4 sets of 6 reps

You'll choose the weights such that you can just finish all the sets. If you
can't finish a set, drop the weights and try to get all the sets done.

If you're in three days a week, you can do something like this:

  - Week 1:
    - Day 1:
      * Deadlifts - workout A
      * Incline - workout A
    - Day 2:
      * Front squats - workout A
      * Incline - workout B
    - Day 3:
      * Deadlifts - workout B
      * Incline - workout C
  - Week 2:
    - Day 1:
      * Front squats - workout B
      * Incline - workout A
    - Day 2:
      * Deadlifts - workout C
      * Incline - workout B
    - Day 3:
      * Front squats - workout C
      * Incline - workout C

After each session, you can throw in some pullups as a finisher: Try three sets
of as many reps as you can get, taking a maybe 30-60 second rest between sets.

Feel free to throw in some other "accessory" type work if you like.
